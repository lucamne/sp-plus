PLATFORM STUFF
------------------------------------------
Create Logging

don't read inputs when window is not focused

bottom of screen is hidden by taskbar, decide what to do about this
pixel drawing seems to be shifted one right
	may just be the way xlib blits to the screen

PROGRAM STUFF
------------------------------------------
create a text field that can display errors, prompts, and allows for input

allow dynamic changing of audio device

Implement a command interface for settings and maybe reading a config

Support loading mp3

SAMPLER
----------------------------------
delete sample

Sample Pad manipulation
	chop sample to other pads

may want pad struct to track sample as well as pad number
	tracking current pad seperately is awkward

Sample init process may need improvements


FILE BROWSER
-----------------------------------------
dialog box for loading samples

Enter working directory
	Requires getting text input

Maybe cancel file load on tab

Load folder into sampler
Pass a filter_file function to platform

MIXER
----------------------------------------------
assign output

tree view

MISC
----------------------------------
Consider making platform_load_entire_file not responsible for allocation
	idk how this would work
Add help / command line
Add error log screen

ISSUES
------------------------------------------------

BONUS
------------------------------------------------
maybe grid for sampler?:
	add auto grid selection
	add snapping
	add grid ui
	add tempo ui

watch handmade!!!
