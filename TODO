PLATFORM STUFF
------------------------------------------
 Create Logging

PROGRAM STUFF
------------------------------------------
Implement a command interface for settings and maybe reading a config

SAMPLER
----------------------------------
Sample Pad manipulation
	chop sample to other pads

may want pad struct to track sample as well as pad number
	tracking current pad seperately is awkward

Sample init process may need improvements

File Browser
-----------------------------------------
Create UI

Enter working directory
	Requires getting text input

Load folder into sampler
Pass a filter_file function to platform

MISC
----------------------------------
Consider making platform_load_entire_file not responsible for allocation
	idk how this would work
Add help / command line
Add error log screen

ISSUES
------------------------------------------------
Popping in green test (seems like it was a hardware issue)

BONUS
------------------------------------------------
maybe grid for sampler?:
	add auto grid selection
	add snapping
	add grid ui
	add tempo ui

watch handmade!!!
