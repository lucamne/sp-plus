PLATFORM STUFF
------------------------------------------
 Create Logging

PROGRAM STUFF
------------------------------------------
Think about mixing and node processing design
	I want to delete samples and their corresponding bus but I do not kow what references the bus

SAMPLER
----------------------------------
Fix copy and move empty samples bug

Sample Pad manipulation
	chop sample to other pads

Sample init process may need improvements

Might want to switch to linked list for bus_ins

File Browser
-----------------------------------------
Allow traversal into and ot of folders

Change working directory

Load folder into sampler

MISC
----------------------------------
Consider making platform_load_entire_file not responsible for allocation
	idk how this would work
Add help / command line
Add error log screen

ISSUES
------------------------------------------------
Popping in green test (seems like it was a hardware issue)

BONUS
------------------------------------------------
maybe grid for sampler?:
	add auto grid selection
	add snapping
	add grid ui
	add tempo ui
